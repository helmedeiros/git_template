# Git Template

This repo has a folder `example` that has a `.gitconfig` file with some
configurations.

### To install
Execute `chmod +x install.sh` then `./install.sh`.

- The installation script will only create a symlink of the `.gitmessage`  and `.git_template` on the root folder. TO actually use it those configurations you will need to follow the config example on the example folder.

**To skip commit hook:**

execute `git commit --no-verify`
